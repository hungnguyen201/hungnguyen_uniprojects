Data analytics is a fasinating world and I found out that I was enchanted under the beauty of raw data, insights and visualizations during my final year at RMIT (March 2021).
Since then, I have been joining competitions to get more expoerience and strenthen my love with data.

This directory contains my works during my final year:

1. RMIT Business Analyst Champion 2021 | Top 10
2. ASEAN Data Science Explorers 2021 | National Finalist (Vietnam)
