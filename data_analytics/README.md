Data analytics is a fasinating world and I found out that I was enchanted under the beauty of raw data, insights and visualizations during my final year at RMIT.
Since then, I have been joining competitions to get more expoerience and strenthen my love with data.

This directory contains my works during my final year:

1. RMIT Business Analyst Champion 2021 | Top 10 (November 2021)
2. ASEAN Data Science Explorers 2021 | Vietnam National Finalist (August 2021)
